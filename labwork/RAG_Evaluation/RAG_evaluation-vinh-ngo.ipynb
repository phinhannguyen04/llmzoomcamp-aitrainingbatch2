              "\" I see. In that case, I'll assume that you want me to provide an example or explanation related to a test context in the context of software development, specifically in the context of testing frameworks like Mocha, Jest, or JUnit.\\n\\nA test context refers to the state and environment that is created when a test is run. It is an object that is passed as an argument to the test function, and it typically contains information about the test runner, the test file, and other related variables.\\n\\nFor instance, in Mocha, a test context might include the `it`, `describe`, `before`, `beforeEach`, and `after` functions, which are used to define test cases and their setup and teardown logic. It might also include a `assert` function for making assertions about the tests results.\\n\\nIn Jest, a test context is an object that contains information like `test`, `describe`, and `expect`, as well as `jest`, which provides access to various testing utilities.\\n\\nHere's an example of a test case in Mocha:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst assert = require('assert');\\n\\ndescribe('Addition', () => {\\n   describe('add(2, 3)', () => {\\n       let calculator;\\n\\n       beforeEach(() => {\\n           calculator = new Calculator();\\n       });\\n\\n       it('returns 5', () => {\\n           const result = calculator.add(2, 3);\\n           assert.strictEqual(result, 5);\\n       });\\n   });\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, the `describe` function defines the context for the test suite, and the `it` function defines a single test case within that context. The `beforeEach` function is used to perform setup logic before each test case is run, in this case, by instantiating a new instance of a `Calculator` class. The test then uses the assert library to make an assertion about the results of the `add` method call.\\n\\nOverall, a test context provides a way to standardize the testing process by defining a common setup and teardown logic for test cases, as well as providing tools for making assertions and verifying test results.\""

This is done by letting each client train the model locally on its data and send its parameters back to the server, which then aggregates all the clients\\u2019 parameters together using a predefined strategy. This process is made very simple by using the [Flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) framework. If you want a more complete overview, be sure to check out this guide: [What is Federated Learning?](https://flower.dev/docs/tutorial/Flower-0-What-is-FL.html)\\n\\n### Creating the IMDBClient\\n\\nTo federate our example to multiple clients, we first need to write our Flower client class (inheriting from `flwr.client.NumPyClient`). This is very easy, as our model is a standard `PyTorch` model:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\\n\\nimport flwr as fl\\n\\n\\nclass IMDBClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):\\n        def get_parameters(self, config):\\n            return [val.cpu().numpy() for _, val in net.state_dict().items()]\\n\\n        def set_parameters(self, parameters):\\n            params_dict = zip(net.state_dict().keys(), parameters)\\n            state_dict = OrderedDict({k: torch.Tensor(v) for k, v in params_dict})\\n            net.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=True)\\n\\n        def fit(self, parameters, config):\\n            self.set_parameters(parameters)\\n            print(\\\"Training Started...\\\")\\n            train(net, trainloader, epochs=1)\\n            print(\\\"Training Finished.\\\")\\n            return self.get_parameters(config={}), len(trainloader), {}\\n\\n        def evaluate(self, parameters, config):\\n            self.set_parameters(parameters)\\n            loss, accuracy = test(net, testloader)\\n            return float(loss), len(testloader), {\\\"accuracy\\\": float(accuracy)}\\n```\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is the name of the custom Flower client class created for the IMDB example?\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IMDBClient\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_doc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"huggingface/blog/blob/main/fl-with-flower.md\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
